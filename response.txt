Come with me on my first ever brand trip. So I've modelled for Hollister before and I love their team so I couldn't believe it when they invited me on this brand trip. The first thing we did was head into the Hollister stores where I saw myself which was so insane but I tried on so many cute pieces. They have the cutest dresses for summer and they brought out balloons and crispy creams. Then we went to dinner and played mini golf. I'm not good at it but the next morning we had this cute breakfast spread. We were heading to a festival so I got ready and my spirits were high. We were excited, we were VIPs. The weather was a little bit grey but I did see Anne-Marie and got this delicious margherita pizza but it did in fact torrential pour but that did not stop me from having a great time. And then the next morning we headed to this cute little cafe. I had this delicious matcha and I had the best time. Thank you Hollister!
